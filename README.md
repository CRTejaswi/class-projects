- [__SIH (2018)__](SIH2018)
> Submissions for [Smart India Hackathon, 2018](https://www.sih.gov.in/sih2018Software). We proposed solutions for 3 problems, out of which 1 was selected. We implemented problem #ISR3, wherein we extracted text from community assets' images.

- [__BE Project2__](BE%20Project2)
> Contents of Bachelor's Degree Project 2 (Semester 8). <br>
>
> __Title:__ Pico-Projector based Automation <br>
> __Aim:__ Classroom automation using a Pico-Projector configured with a Raspberry Pi server.<br>
> Makes use of WebRTC for in-browser communication & UV4L for screen-mirroring.

- [__BE Project1__](BE%20Project1)
> Contents of Bachelor's Degree Project 1 (Semester 7).
>
> __Title:__ OCR based Information Assistant<br>
> __Aim:__ Real-Time text-extraction from images, and conversion to speech.<br>
> Makes use of Tesseract-OCR for text-extraction & gTTS for text-to-speech conversion.

- [__Personal Info Assistant__](Personal%20Info%20Assistant)
> QRCode-based info-assistant examples.<br>
> Makes use of QPython3 application for Android.

- [__AVR-GSM__](AVR-GSM)
> GSM communication with 8-bit AVRµc (ATmega32) using C, in AVRStudio4.

- [__Sampling Theorem__](Sampling%20Theorem)
> Simple lowpass and bandpass filter implementation in MATLAB (as an application of Sampling Theorem).

- [__8085-ADC&DAC__](8085-ADC&DAC)
> ADC-DAC communication with 8-bit 8085µp using x86-asm.

- [__Mod100Counter__](Mod100Counter)
> A Mod-100 Counter hardware implemtation using IC-7490 (Decade Counter) & IC-74248 (BCD to 7-Segment Decoder) that loops through 00-99.

- [__World Time Interface__](World%20Time%20Interface)
> Simple HTML Script to display current time for 150 countries.

- [__PPTs__](PPTs)
> Consists of PPTs presented as classwork, uploaded as PDF files.
